# 🛍️ Custom WooCommerce Catalog Page (Without Plugins)

This project is a **custom-built WooCommerce-style catalog page** developed entirely with **PHP and WordPress**, **without using any plugins** for importing or displaying products.

It fulfills the assignment requirements to create a **catalog page** that dynamically imports products from a **CSV file** and displays them with sorting, filtering, and infinite scroll — replicating the functionality and layout of the [Blue Nile Wedding Rings Catalog](https://www.bluenile.com/wedding-rings/all-wedding-rings?hasNoStones=yes).
